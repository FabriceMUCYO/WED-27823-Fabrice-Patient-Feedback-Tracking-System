## The Three Main Charts

**Top Chart (Pie Chart) - Types of Feedback**
Shows 4 types of comments we received, each representing 25% of total feedback:
- Positive comments about doctors and pediatric care
- Complaints about long waiting times
- Praise for quick emergency service

**Bottom Left (Bar Chart) - Patients Who Gave Feedback**
Three patients provided feedback: David Lee, John Smith, and Mary Johnson. Each contributed equally to our data.

**Bottom Right (Stacked Bar Chart) - Feedback Volume & Ratings**
This shows which comments got mentioned most and their satisfaction ratings:
- "Very quick service in emergency" - Most mentioned (12 times) with HIGH ratings ✓
- "Doctor was good but waiting time long" - 8 mentions with MIXED ratings
- "Waited 3 hours, not good" - 6 mentions with LOW ratings ✗
- "Excellent pediatric care" - 5 mentions with HIGH ratings ✓

## What We Learned

**Good News:**
- Emergency services are excellent - fast and high quality
- Pediatric care receives only positive feedback
- Patients appreciate our doctors

**Problem Area:**
- Waiting times are too long (mentioned in half of all feedback)
- Some patients waited 3 hours

## Simple Recommendation
Keep doing what we're doing in emergency and pediatric departments, but urgently fix the waiting time problem in other areas.

## Bottom Line
We're great at emergency care and specialized services but we're losing patient satisfaction because of long wait times. Fix the waiting times and overall satisfaction will significantly improve
